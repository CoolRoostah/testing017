Video Order:>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>



*************When it comes to videoing the self; the order is: 
((((Potential Title:>>>>>>('in under __min?')>>>>>>>>>>> Uminion Tech #18 VLesson 001: (Beginner-To-Intermediate-Level-Coding-Lesson:) A.) How to push your Code from Microsoft Code to a Github Repo using Git (Bash) via SSH; B.) and integrating a .ymlFile from GitHub Actions with a Hostinger FTP to autodeploy/autobuild/autopatch your website in real time during a 'Git Add/Git Commit/Git Push' sequence. C.) and then Cloning a Repo from Github to our Microsoft Code via Git Remote using HTTPS to test if our system works. Presented by: StorytellingSalem for Uminion dot com's Union Tech #18 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<)))

Chapter 1:> The Preview & Goal:>
((((((((((((DURING Preview:> Share these words, while the preview is happening in the background, of snipbits of your finished product; AND OF YOU "Getting it ready")))))))))))
	-"A.)Today we're going to take some essential code from our uminion.com's website, B.) put it on Github- C.) and then connect it to Hostinger's FTP system- via Github Actions; so D.) when we git push; it automatically updates our website again. E.) The goal of this educational video is to change this word: "submit" to "upload" and then F.) use git clone remote to change it back from "upload" to "submit" G.) using both a combination of HTTPS and SSH. 
Due to the headyness of what we're covering today, we ask you to politely share the like/subscribe/ and even share button to share to a coder friend you know. You will be able to find copy pasteable code in the description below of what was covered; & with that; let's begin after covering our Table of Contents:

(Don't read this outloud, just pause it for a second and then move on saying: "Pause to read; and with that; lets move on:"***move on***)
Chapter 1.) is the Preview & Goal
Chapter 2.) is "Taking the essential code from our website so we can put it on github"
Chapter 3.) is us downloading all we need and integrating it with each other
Chapter 4.) 


Chapter 2.) "This is what we'll be doing today"

1.) Preview while talking over on what we're going to do and then saying: "lets get started:"
	---------maybe the 'preview' is me 'preparing the uminion.com page' via sharing what the uminion.com webpage looks like; ((((starting off with an empty browser, and then going to internet explorer, and then from there doing F12, console, and then going to uminion.com; so we can see a working console)))))
			-and testing it out with the audio to see if it worked via sharing: "Today we will be putting up our code on Github" 
			-(and showing how that works; while also saying; we will change 'submit' to 'upload' for demonstration purposes) 
	-and then that way when im conducting the video; (i can 'start' with a 'do a zip file to backup everything' 
		-and then 'unzip in my d drive'
		-& then: remove the code: 
			-from the d drive's includes folder (the pictures and images in MY folder) 
			-and remove the hostinger's code's includes, (the '.php files except db connection') 
				-and then we will revisit uminion.com and refresh the page; so the 'audio no longer works when trying to submit something.'  and console having errors. 
			-Then we remove fromm the 'd drive' everything else but the includes and themes folder; 
			-then from hostinger we remove the themes folder
				-then we revisit uminion.com and we should see an empty site; 






2.) how to download microsoft code
3.) how to download git bash and make it a default terminal in microsoft code
	-Note; if this is your first time using a git terminal; you must add these:
		- GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL USER.NAME <USERNAME> <<<<<<<<<<<<type in your username without the brackets so for me it'd be:>>>>>>>>>> GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL USER.NAME Salem 
		- GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL USER.EMAIL <EMAIL> <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< type in your email without the brackets so for me it'd be:>>>>>>>>>> GIT CONFIG --GLOBAL USER.EMAIL "StorytellingSalem@outlook.com"

4.) how to create a new repo (and where to go to figure out what kind of license youd like>>> https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ 

5.) go over to microsoft code and stay there till we create new ssh key & copy it
6.) go over to github and paste ssh key

7.) Now that we've setup our code editor, git bash terminal, and github repo; we're going back to microsoft code again; to: connect our code to github till its done. 





Notes:>>>. 



End somewhere:> have yourself upload a randmo txt file like the instructions of conducting this video or just something; through git via pushing to a repo via https or something


when you want to talk about something specific, you do it in 'issues' like "Quests:> (then write down a bunch and just make it in the video APPEAR like overnight or so)"
and if you want to do something like:> "and if you want to talk about general/anything else- you do it over in 'community chats' like via ***checking out the Lessons 1-11+*** here: ***and making these appear overnight or so to*** to add in or so (atleast pinned folders or so or atleast one folder thats pinned) 



copy the .yml file from #14(?)! since its got notes!


((((((((((((((((Dont forget to test site after FTP to make sure it works. both audio files and themes should be working ))))))))))))))
